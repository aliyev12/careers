Rebuilt the apps with an extremely efficient framework for static site generation – Gatsby JS. Built the apps following application best practices, making them efficient, fast, responsive, and accessible. Newly resigned sites continue to receive great user feedback, and since the redesign, the popularity of the site grew exponentially from an average of 10k people per month to over 200k. Introduced a help center and chatbot features to Benefits.gov. Both features I have built to provide the most useful information to the users. Ever since the new help center and chatbot have been brought to our site, the number of user emails went significantly down, roughly from on average 2000 per month to less than 300. This was due to the fact that the new help center design was much easier to navigate, and the custom-built chatbot with cognitive capabilities is able to find many of the answers users are looking for. Introduced user authentication to Benefits.gov by leveraging Login.gov service. This feature is aimed at providing users with more custom experiences and capability to store various search results within their accounts. \n•DOL, Office of Administrative Law Judges: Took part in the development of search feature overhaul by implementing Azure's Cognitive Search which as of GA reports from August 2020 achieved a 40% increase in the usability and customer satisfaction of the website's searching capability. \n•DOL, Foreign Labor Application Gateway: Contributed to a major redesign of the application suite. The redesigned application helped expedite the processing time for cases from 12-16 months to 10-14 months. Also, it significantly improved the uptime of the website during the busiest seasons. ",

Ever since the new help center and chatbot have been brought to our site, the number of user emails went significantly down, roughly from on average 2000 per month to less than 300. This was due to the fact that the new help center design was much easier to navigate, and the custom-built chatbot with cognitive capabilities is able to find many of the answers users are looking for. Introduced user authentication to Benefits.gov by leveraging Login.gov service. This feature is aimed at providing users with more custom experiences and capability to store various search results within their accounts. • DOL, Office of Administrative Law Judges: Took part in the development of search feature overhaul by implementing Azure's Cognitive Search which as of GA reports from August 2020 achieved a 40% increase in the usability and customer satisfaction of the website's searching capability. • DOL, Foreign Labor Application Gateway: Contributed to a major redesign of the application suite.
